# Menus and Tables of Content

A Table of Contents is a manifest that lists the pages of a given section of the Ensembl 2020 web site (such as Help&Documentation, or About Ensembl), and establishes the hierarchy of these pages.

A Table of Contents should be capable of describing the menu for the appropriate section of the site. The Table of Contents will be automatically transformed into a serialized representation of the menu at the build time of the help&docs api server. 


## Guiding principles

- Every page that has to be accessible via the site menu must be listed in the Table of Contents.
- Every page that has to be accessible via the site menu must have a stable url associated with it. The url should be derivable from the location of a document file on the file system; but it should also be possible to associate a custom url with the page.
- The Table of Contents is described in `toc.yml` file(s).
- An item in the table of contents can refer to:
  - a document file within any subfolder of the `docs` folder
  - a web page, either on ensembl.org or on any other web site
  - another table of contents file (typically, in a subdirectory relative to the current toc.yml file)


Note:
- A menu is not the same as a list of links to articles related to a given article. There is no provision in TOC.yml for establishing any kinds of relationships between articles other than their simple hierarchy.


## The structure of a toc.yml file

A toc.yml file can be formatted in one of two ways:

1. As a list of items
2. As a dictionary with an `items` field containing a list of items; as well as other fields with additional pieces of metadata

### Examples:

1. A list of items

```yml
- name: "How-to1"
  href: howto1.md
- name: "How-to2"
  href: howto2.md
```

2. A dictionary with extra metadata: `directory_path` provides a custom namespace for the urls of individual files listed in this table of contents.

```yml
directory_path: /about/legal # or should it be called pathname?
items:
  - name: Privacy and Cookies
    href: privacy-and-cookies.md
  - name: Disclaimer
    href: disclaimer.md
  - name: Software License
    href: software-license.md
```

## Table of contents items

An item of a table of contents can have the following fields:

| Field      | Optional | Semantics                         |
|------------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| name       | no       | Name of a page as it appears in the menu
| href       | yes      | Path to the page file or to a toc file. Alternatively, full url of an existing online page
| url        | yes      | Custom url that you want to assign to this page
| topicHref  | yes      | see Sequence


Possibly also required:
- `type` (i.e. article vs video vs index.yml)

## Use cases

### I just want to link to a markdown file

Given that the documentation file is in the same directory as the toc.yml file:

```yml
- name: My documentation page
  href: my-documentation-file.md
```

### I want to create a submenu 

#### Example 1: submenu does not have its own page

User's interactions with the menu item (e.g. clicking or mousing over) will only expand the submenu. There is no page to open in response to interacting with this menu item.

```yml
- name: A title for a menu item that will show a submenu
  href: child-folder/toc.yml
```

#### Example 2: submenu has its own page

Clicking on the menu item will open a dedicated page associated with this submenu. User will likely also see a control for just showing the submenu without being taken to the index page for this submenu.

```yml
- name: Title of a menu item
  href: child-folder/toc.yml
  topicHref: my-index-page.yml
```

#### Example 3: submenu has a custom url namespace

Normally, submenus will generate their url namespaces automatically, by combining the namespace of the parent (sub)menu with the name of the directory in which the toc.yml of the submenu is located. Thus, in examples 1 and 2, if the namespace of the parent menu is `/about`, then the namespace generated for the submenu will be `/about/child-folder`. This can be overridden using the `url` field of the TOC item. The snippet below, for the same parent menu namespace, will result in the `/about/customized-directory-name`.

```yml
- name: Title of a menu item
  href: child-folder/toc.yml
  url: customized-directory-name
```


## Prior art
The conventions for annotating the `toc.yml` files are modified from the specifications of the [DocFX documentation generator by Microsoft](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/intro_toc.html) (see the [TOC section](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/intro_toc.html) of its documentation).
