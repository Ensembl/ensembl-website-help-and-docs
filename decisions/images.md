# Images for the docs

## Screenshots

To take images of a whole page, scale your browser to 1200 px wide (you may need to turn on developer tools to see the size of the page) on your laptop retina display screen and take a screenshot.

Open in gimp.

Drop the arrow.png image into the screenshot wherever you want to add a label â€“ flip/rotate to the orientation you need it at.
