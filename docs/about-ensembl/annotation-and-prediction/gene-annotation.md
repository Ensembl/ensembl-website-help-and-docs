# Gene annotation
Gene annotation is the plotting of genes onto genome assemblies, and indexing their genomic coordinates. Gene annotation may be generated by Ensembl using automatic and manual methods (for vertebrate genomes), or they may be imported from different projects and consortia (for non-vertebrate genomes). 

Gene annotation generated by Ensembl includes automatic annotation by genome-wide determination of transcripts. All Ensembl transcripts are based on experimental evidence and thus the automated pipeline relies on the mRNAs and protein sequences deposited into public databases from the scientific community. For selected species, gene annotation may also include manual curation by HAVANA, where transcripts are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For many species, Ensembl imports annotations from different projects and consortia. Please see individual species' information pages to learn more about the speciesâ€™ gene annotation method and origin of the data.
