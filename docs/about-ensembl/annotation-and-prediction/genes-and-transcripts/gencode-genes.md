# The GENCODE gene sets

The [GENCODE Project](https://www.gencodegenes.org) at the EBI is responsible for manual annotation of selected vertebrate genomes, primarily human and mouse. The aim of the GENCODE Project is to  to improve the coverage and accuracy of the GENCODE human and mouse gene sets by enhancing and extending the annotation of all evidence-based gene features in the human genome at a high accuracy, including protein-coding loci with alternatively splices variants, non-coding loci and pseudogenes.
