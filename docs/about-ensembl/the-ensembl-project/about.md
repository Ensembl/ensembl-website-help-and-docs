# About the Ensembl project

The Ensembl project has three goals: to provide a comprehensive source of stable genome annotation, to enable genomic interpretation, and to support researcher driven analysis.

Ensembl generates and imports genome annotation such as genes, variation, regulation and comparative genomics for vertebrates, non-vertebrates and key model organisms, and makes this information freely available online.

The website provides visualisations and functionality that enable the manipulation and analysis of this data. Information about genes, transcripts and further annotation can be retrieved at the genome, gene and protein level.

The Ensembl project is headed by [Paul Flicek](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/paul-flicek) and receives input from an independent scientific advisory board. Our resources are created by a talented group numbering over 70 people, split into thematic teams developing our analysis methods, executing these analyses, developing our online resources and providing engagement with the wider scientific community.

You can read more about ongoing developments in Ensembl [on our blog](http://www.ensembl.info/).
