# Privacy and cookies

## Cookies

At the moment, the only cookies set by this website are for Google Analytics.

Ensembl uses Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but we donâ€™t use it to track you individually or collect personal data. Instead it collects information about website performance and how users navigate through and use our sites, helping us design better interfaces.

Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your anonymised IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp and similar information. We do not link this information to any of your personal data.

Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a [browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to opt out of Google Analytics tracking.

## Privacy policy

More information about personal data collection on other services provided by the Ensembl project can be found on our [privacy policy page](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/data-protection/ensembl/privacy-notice) on the EBI website.

Note that this site lacks some of the features of our other websites, e.g. user accounts, so not all sections will apply.
