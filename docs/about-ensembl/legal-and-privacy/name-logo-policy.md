The Ensembl name and logotype are the property of EMBL and are protected by international trademark law. For all proposed uses of the Ensembl logotype, permission should be sought in advance by writing to Ensembl. Permission must be sought for any commercial use, and enquires may be sent via the Contact us form.

## General use of the logotype

Do not modify (stretch, alter or add to) the logotype in any way except to change it in size as required.

The minimum sizes are: 24mm wide (png, jpg, or in print) or 90px wide (svg, or on screen).

Do not use colours that have low contrast with the background colour.

Where the logotype is set against a dark background, the logotype should appear in white.

Ensemblâ€™s general policy is to permit use of the Ensembl logotype in the context of activities associated with use of the Ensembl code, but not in any manner that suggests or implies that the Ensembl project or EMBL-EBI has endorsed or approved of the activities, products, and/or services of the organisation, or that Ensembl is the source of any such activities, products, and/or services.

## Use of the logotype by Ensembl mirrors

Ensembl grants mirror sites a limited right to use its logo. Ensembl mirrors may use the Ensembl name and logotype as provided as part of the default Ensembl webcode installation. This policy applies to both unsupported and official, supported mirrors.

For example, the official Ensembl logotype may be used on external websites to identify official collaboration with Ensembl, or to link to either the [main Ensembl website](https://2020.ensembl.org) or an Ensembl mirror site.
