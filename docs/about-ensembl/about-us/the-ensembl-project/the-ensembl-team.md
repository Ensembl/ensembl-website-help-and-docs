## Annotation

### Genebuild

Responsible for our internal annotation of genomes, including assembly loading, repeat-masking, and gene annotation.

### Variation

Creates infrastructure to manage and annotate genomic variation data and phenotype/disease 
associations. Develops and maintains tools including VEP, Variant recoder, the LD caclulator. 
Projects include Ensembl, IGSR and G2P.

### Regulation

Responsible for importing experimental data and annotating functional elements and regulatory information.

### Compara

Integrates our genomic annotation across species by generating gene trees, homologies and alignments.

### Havana

Responsible for manual annotation of genes on a selection of key species, primarily human and mouse.

### Microbes

Responsible for importing community annotation of fungal, protist and prokaryotic genomes.

### Plants

Responsible for importing community annotation of plant genomes, focusing particularly on crop species such as wheat, rice and barley.

### Metazoa

Responsible for importing community annotation of invertebrate genomes.

### WormBase/AGR

Responsible for EBI's contribution to a collection of collaborative resources in the area of nematode, flatworm and model organism genomics (WormBase, WormBase ParaSite, The Alliance of Genome Resources)

## Development and support

### Infrastructure

Develops and maintains the core database and associated API, the current [REST API](https://rest.ensembl.org), and eHive.

### Applications

Develops and maintains various projects, including [Tark](http://tark.ensembl.org/) and the [Trackhub Registry](https://www.trackhubregistry.org).

### Web team

Develops and maintains this website and other websites under the ensembl.org domain, as well as the [Ensembl blog](https://www.ensembl.info).

### Production

Responsible for management of data release, execution of pipelines during the release cycle and development of associated software infrastructure.

### Outreach

Responsible for spreading awareness and education for Ensembl. They also manage the help desk.
