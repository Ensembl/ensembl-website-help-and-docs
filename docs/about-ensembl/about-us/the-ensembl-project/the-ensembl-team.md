# The Ensembl team

The Ensembl project is headed by Paul Flicek and receives input from an independent scientific advisory board.

Currently, the Ensembl group consists of around nn people, divided in a number of teams.

## Annotation

### Genebuild

Responsible for our internal annotation of genomes, including assembly loading, repeat-masking, and gene annotation.

### Variation

Creates infrastructure to manage and annotate genomic variation data and phenotype/disease 
associations. Develops and maintains tools including VEP, Variant recoder, the LD caclulator. 
Projects include Ensembl, IGSR and G2P.

### Regulation

Responsible for importing experimental data and annotating functional elements and regulatory information.

### Compara

Integrates our genomic annotation across species by generating gene trees, homologies and alignments.

### Havana

Responsible for manual annotation of genes on a selection of key species, primarily human and mouse.

### Microbes

Responsible for fungal, protist and prokaryotic genomes.

### Plants

Responsible for plant genomes, focusing particularly on crop species.

### Metazoa

Responsible for invertebrate genomes.

### WormBase/AGR

Responsible for EBI's contribution to a collection of collaborative resources in the area of nematode, flatworm and model organism genomics (WormBase, WormBase ParaSite, The Alliance of Genome Resources)

## Development and support

### Infrastructure

Develops and maintains the core database and associated API, the current [REST API](https://rest.ensembl.org), and eHive.

### Applications

Develops and maintains various projects, including [Tark](http://tark.ensembl.org/) and the [Trackhub Registry](https://www.trackhubregistry.org).

### Web team

Develops and maintains this website and other websites under the ensembl.org domain, as well as the [Ensembl blog](https://www.ensembl.info).

### Production

Responsible for management of data release, execution of pipelines during the release cycle and development of associated software infrastructure.

### Outreach

Responsible for spreading awareness and education for Ensembl. They also manage the help desk.
