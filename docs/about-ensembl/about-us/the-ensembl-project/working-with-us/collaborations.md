# Collaborations

Ensembl is funded by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and by grants from a variety of different [funding sources](/about/articles/funding). In addition to direct funding, we benefit from long term collaborations with a number of consortia developing genome annotation resources in particular areas.

We are also active participants in a number of specific genome annotation projects, and are open to new collaborations in many forms, from seeking joint funding to establish a new domain-focused resource, to an informal collaboration to annotate a particular genome (or to develop an alternative genome-wide data set) and prepare it for inclusion in Ensembl. We also regularly participate in the [Google Summer of Code](/about/articles/gsoc) scheme.

Please email us via the contact button in the top right corner of any page to discuss any form of collaboration.
