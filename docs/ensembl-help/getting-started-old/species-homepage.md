# Species Homepage
The Species Homepage allows you to retreive information about the genome assembly and gene annotation for each species. To exit from the Species Homepage and return to the Species Selector, click the blue cross icon next to the 'Species Homepage' header.

## Selecting Species
Under the 'Species Homepage' header, the species and assembly name are displayed with options to 'Use', 'Don't Use' or 'Remove' this species.

You can toggle between 'Use' and 'Don't Use' by clicking on the toggle button. When 'Use' is selected, this species will appear in the species lost in all apps. 'Don't use' will disable this species in other apps, but will not remove it from your list in the Species Selector. To remove the species from your list in the Species Selector, click 'Remove'.

## Statistics Table 
The table displays summary statistics with the number of coding genes, non-coding genes, pseudogenes as well as a summary of the genome assembly. To find further information about each category, click on the expand icon to find more detailed information.

You can also click on 'Example gene' or 'Example region' to view a gene or region in the Entity Viewer or Genome Browser.

## Summary Panel
The Summary Panel can be opened and closed using the '>' icon on the right hand side of the Species Homepage. The Summary Panel contains information about the genome assembly and gene annotation, including the INSDC accession number, assembly level and the gene annotation method and date.
