# Removing species

You can remove selected species by hovering your cursor over the species of interest. You can 'turn off' a species, without removing it from your selected species list by clicking 'Do not use'. You can remove selected species from the list altogether by clicking on the 'X'.

Selected species that are turned off can be turned on by hovering your cursor over the species name and clicking 'Use'.
