# How to download sequences

You can download gene, cDNA, CDS and peptide sequences from the Genome browser and Entity viewer apps.

In the Genome browser, you can access sequence download through the pop-up menus on a transcript's track or in the Track drawer.

The Track drawer is opened by selecting the elipses to the right of the Track name in the Track panel.

In the Entity viewer, you can access sequence download through the pop-up menus on a transcript's track, the Track drawer or the download icon in the Action bar.

You can download sequences as a FASTA file which is suitable for using with sequence analysis tools.
