# Get sequences

You can export sequences from the Genome Browser and Entity viewer apps using the Sequence download tool:

## Genome browser

In the genome browser, you can download gene and transcript sequences by clicking on the quick download link in the drawer or by clicking on the interactive transcript model and selecting the appropriate sequence to download.

You can either download as FASTA, suitable for using with sequence analysis tools, or as rich text format (RTF), for visual analysis.

## Entity viewer

In the entity viewer, you can download the sequence of your transcript of interest by clicking on the interactive transcript and selecting from the download options or by clicking on the download icon on the right hand side of the page.


From both the Genome browser and the Entity viewer you can export sequences of genomic regions, cDNAs, CDSs and peptides.
