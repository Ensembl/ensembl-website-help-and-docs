# Find out about a gene

To find your gene of interest, you must start by selecting your species genome of interest using the Species selector:

Gene data is found in both the Genome browser and the Entity viewer apps:

Use the Genome browser to view a gene and its transcripts in the context of the genome. The gene is shown in the context of genomic features such as neighbouring genes(coding and non-coding), forward or reverse strands and assembly information.

Use the Entity viewer to find details about the gene and its different transcripts, including protein domains, links out to other databases and sequences.

Select either the Genome browser or the Entity viewer app. Once in your chosen app use search to find your gene of interest and select to display the gene's data in the app.
