# How to get started with the Ensembl website

The new Ensembl website is an ongoing project to provide access to Ensembl data through visualisation in a redesigned web interface. 

A data set of the genes, transcripts and proteins for over 300 genomes has been made available so far and more will continue to be released. 

New interfaces for presenting a range of other data types, such as variation, homology and regulation are also being released periodically.

## Apps

There are currently five different apps, each allowing you to perform a specific task or providing visualisation of different data types for your genomes of interest. 

The five apps currently available:


![](../../img/id-species-selector.svg)

The Species selector allows you to view and select the species genome assemblies that you wish to view in the Genome browser and Entity viewer.


![](../../img/id-genome-browser.svg)

Use the Genome browser to explore a genomic region and view a gene and its transcripts in the context of the genome.


![](../../img/id-entity-viewer.svg)

Use the Entity viewer to look at gene details, including transcript structures, protein domains, links out to other databases and sequences.


![](../../img/id-blast.svg)

The BLAST app allows you to compare DNA, RNA and/or protein sequence information.
