# Known Bugs

Ensembl strives to deliver the highest quality resources for the research community. However, there are times that we discover errors in our released databases either due to our own mistakes or errors and inconsistencies in our input data sources. We list these bugs here as they are discovered. In every case, we correct these bugs as soon as they are discovered and normally provide these corrections in the next Ensembl release.

A [list of known bugs](https://www.ensembl.info/known-bugs/ensembl-beta/) is available on the Ensembl blog.
