# Previously viewed

You can find Previously viewed (bookmark icon) in the Action bar within the Entity viewer and Genome browser.

Previously viewed is an auto-generated within-app browsing history, which remembers up to 20 recently viewed genes. It lists the previously viewed genes in chronological order in the right hand panel, including links to their corresponding pages. You can keep track of the pages you've visited and go back to previously viewed genes from here.
