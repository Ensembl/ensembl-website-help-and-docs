# Downloading sequences

You can download genomic sequence, cDNA, CDS and peptide sequences from the Genome browser and Entity viewer apps.

## Where to find Download 

In the Genome browser, you can access sequence Download in the pop-up menus on a transcripts track or in its Track drawer.

In the Entity viewer, you can access sequence Download through the pop-up menus on a transcripts track, in its Track drawer or the Download icon in the Action bar.

## Download options

You can export genomic sequence, cDNA, CDS and protein sequence for transcripts and genomic sequence for a gene.

Select Download to reveal customisation options, make your sequence choices by ticking the appropriate boxes and hit the green Download button to export sequence data in FASTA format. You can select multiple options at once.

Sequences are exported in a FASTA file, which is suitable for use with sequence analysis tools.
