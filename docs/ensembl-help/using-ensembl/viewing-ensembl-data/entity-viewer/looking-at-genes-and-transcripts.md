# Looking at genes and transcripts

The main view shows a visualisation of all the transcripts of a gene. You can filter the transcripts by biotype (as long as there are more than 3 transcripts), and view additional information about each transcript, including its protein domains, by clicking on the name of the transcript in the righthand column.
