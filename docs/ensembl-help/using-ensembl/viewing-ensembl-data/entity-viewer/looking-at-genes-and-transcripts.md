# Looking at genes and transcripts

The main view shows a visualisation of all the transcripts of a gene. You can filter the transcripts by biotype (as long as there are more than three transcripts), and view additional information about each transcript, including its protein domains, by clicking on the name of the transcript in the righthand column.
