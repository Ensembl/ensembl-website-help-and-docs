# Genome Browser

The Genome Browser App allows you to browse genes, variants and other annotation features aligned to the reference genome.

The Genome Browser is divided into a number of sections:

 - Species Tabs
 - Navigation Bar
 - Genome Browser
 - Track Panel
  
### Species Tabs
 
The species of interest and the genome assemblies are listed in the Species Tabs at the top of the page. You can navigate between the different selected species by clicking on the individual species tab. You can add or change the species of interest by clicking on 'Change' in the Species panel to navigate to the Species Selector.

### Navigation Bar

The chromosome/scaffold number and genomic coordinates are displayed in the navigation bar above the genome browser display. Clicking on the coordinates will show/hide options to zoom in/out of the genomic region of interest or to scroll upstream/downstream along the genome. 

To search for a new genomic region of interest, click on 'Change' within the navigation bar and enter genomic coordinates, e.g 4:122868000-122946000.

### Genome Browser
The Genome Browser presents data in tracks, which are each aligned to the reference genome assembly.

You can scroll upstream/downstream by clicking and dragging on the Genome Browser with your cursor. You can zoom in/out by hovering your cursor on the Genome browser and scrolling up/down.

### Track Panel
You can find more information about the data presented within a track using the Track Panel. You can view the Track Panel by clicking on the > icon at the top of the Action Button bar.
