# What is the Variant Effect Predictor(VEP)

The Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) determines the effect of your variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions, CNVs or structural variants) on genes, transcripts, protein sequences and regulatory regions.

Simply input the coordinates of your variants and the nucleotide changes to find out the:

* __genes and transcripts__ affected by the variants
* __location__ of the variants (e.g. upstream of a transcript, in coding sequence, in non-coding RNA, in regulatory regions)
* __consequence__ of your variants on the protein sequence (e.g. stop gained, missense, stop lost, frameshift), see variant consequences.
* __known variants__ that match yours, and associated minor allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project
* __SIFT and PolyPhen-2 scores__ for changes to protein sequence

... and more! See data types, versions.
