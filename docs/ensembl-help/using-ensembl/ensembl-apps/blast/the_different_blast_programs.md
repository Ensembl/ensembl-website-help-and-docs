# The different BLAST programs

The following BLAST programs are available:

- BLASTn: nucleotide sequences against nucleotide databases
- tBLASTn: translated nucleotide sequences against a nucleotide database
- tBLASTx: translated nucleotide sequences against a translated nucleotide database
- BLASTp: peptide sequences against peptide databases
- BLASTx: nucleotide sequences against amino acid databases

The relevant BLAST programs are selected automatically and displayed in the Program drop-down menu when the target database is selected and the Nucleotide or Protein option is selected above the sequence text box. The BLAST programs have pre-configured parameters, which you can view and change by clicking on the ‘Parameters’ option.
