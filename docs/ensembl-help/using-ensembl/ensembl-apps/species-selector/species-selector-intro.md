# How do I add or remove a species?

You can use the Species selector to:

- choose a genome for a species, to work with in other apps 
- create a list of genomes, to work with in other apps 
- remove a genome from your list and 
- explore the genes of genome.

## How to choose a species genome

You must select a species genome to start using any Ensembl app. 

You can then investigate the genes, variants and orthologues of that species genome in another app ie the Genome browser or Entity viewer.


There are two ways to select a species genome in the Species selector:

### Choose a genome from the 42 most popular species.

Select the icon representing your species of interest from the 42 most popular species.

You will see a table of the genome assemblies for that species.

Pick the genome assembly you are interested in by marking the box to the left of an assembly and selecting the Add button.

The selected genome name and assembly appear in a lozenge at the top of the view in each app.

### Search for a species genome

You can search for a species genome, using the: 
* common name 
* scientific name
* type, strain or cultivar
* assembly name and
* assembly accession number.

Depending on your search term you will see:

* a species genome assembly or
* a table of the genome assemblies.

Pick the genome assembly you are interested in by marking the box to the left of an assembly and selecting the green Add button.

The selected genome name and assembly appear in a lozenge at the top of each app.

## How to create a list of species genomes

You can create a of species genomes by adding multiple genomes from a table of assemblies.

![Species marked for selection in a genome assembly table](media/selecting-from-table.png)

The collection of species genomes can be used in all other apps, ie the Genome browser or Entity viewer.

The species genome lozenges are displayed in a row at the top of each app.

### How to find specific genomes in a large table of assemblies

The genome assembly table for each species displays information chosen to help you decide which genome assemblies you would like to work with. ie Assembly name, Assembly accession number, type, strain and cultivar.

#### How to filter the table contents

You can also filter a table of genome assemblies by entering the:

* common name 
* scientific name
* type, strain or cultivar
* assembly name
* assembly accession number
* annotation provider or
* annotation method

into the filter box above the table of genome assemblies.

## Removing a species genome

You can remove by selecting the 'Remove' button on the Species homepage.

![Remove species button on species homepage](media/remove-button-species-homepage.png)

A warning message will be displayed. Select the green 'Remove species' button to delete the species genome fron your list.

## Deactivating a species genome in your list

You can deactivate a species genome by toogling to 'Don't use' at the top of the Species homepage.

<img src="media/do-not-use-ss.png" width="320" alt="Do not use selected">

The deactivated species genome lozenge will remain in your list and turn grey. Active species genome lozenges reamin blue.

## The Species homepage  

The Species homepage contains more information about the genes, variants of species genome, details about the genome assembly and the controls to manage a list of species genomes. 

You can navigate to a Species homepage by clicking on the individual species name.
