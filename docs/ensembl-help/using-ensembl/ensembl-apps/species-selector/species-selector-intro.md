#  How do I add or remove a species?

The Species selector allows you to view and select the species genomes and assemblies that you wish to view in the Genome browser and Entity viewer.

## Selecting a species

In order to start using the Genome browser and Entity viewer, you need to select a species genome and assembly. 

There are two ways to select a species genome:

1.  Select from an initial selection of 7 popular species genomes. The 42 most popular species genomes will be available in the future.

> Select the icon representing your species genome of interest from the 42 most popular species genomes and select the green 'Add' button.
 
2.  Search for a species genomes

> Type the name of a species genome or assembly into the search box and select a species genome from the auto-complete options in the drop-down menu. 

If there are more than one genome assembly available for your species of interest, a drop-down menu will appear allowing you to select your genome assembly of interest. 
Use the green 'Add' button to select the species genome.

When a species genome has been selected the species and assembly name will appear at the top of the page.

## Creating a list of Species 

You can add multiple species genomes and create a list of species genomes in the Species selector. 

The list of species genomes between them when in other apps such as the Genome browser or Entity viewer.


## The Species homepage  

The Species homepage contains more information about the genes, variants of species genome, details about the genome assembly and the controls to manage a list of species genomes. 

You can navigate to a Species homepage by clicking on the individual species' name. 

## Removing a species genome

You can remove or disable selected species from the Species homepage by selecting the 'Remove' button.
