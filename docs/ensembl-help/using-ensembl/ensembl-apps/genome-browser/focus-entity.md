# What is a Focus entity?

The gene or location (or other entities such as variants in the future) you have searched for will be front and centre in the Genome browser view and is known as the Focus entity. 

The boundaries of Focus entity are highlighted in the browser by red dotted lines. 

The name and/or identifier and coordinates of the Focus entity are displayed in the Navigation bar. 

Details of the Focus entity, for example the symbol for a gene and the number of its transcripts, are displayed at the top of the right-hand Track panel.
