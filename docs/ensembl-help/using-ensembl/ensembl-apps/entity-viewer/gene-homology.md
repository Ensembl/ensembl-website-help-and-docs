# How to find homologous genes in the Entity viewer

Homologous genes share a common ancestor, being separated 'split' by a speciation event or a gene duplication event.

A list of homologous genes for a given gene are found in the homology table. 

The homology table for a gene is the first tab in the gene relationship panel found in the detailed view of a gene in the Entity viewer.

For each gene homologue found in another species genome the following information is provided:

* Common name: Domestic guinea pig
* Scientific name: Cavia porcellus
* % protein similarity: The percentage of identical amino acid residues aligned against each other.
* % coverage: The percent of query which is in local alignment with the respective reference.
* Gene symbol: Gene symbol for homologues in each species - these may vary between species .
* Gene ID: the Ensembl ID - ENSG eg ENSCPOG00000005153.4.
* Hit type: The type of homology: RBBH: reciprocal best blast hit, BBH: best blast hit.
* Assembly: Genome assembly.

### Customising the table

Customised to reorder the table based on the different columns by clicking on the arrow next to each column heading. 

You can customise all rows, or select specific hits, by clicking on the box in the first column of each row.
