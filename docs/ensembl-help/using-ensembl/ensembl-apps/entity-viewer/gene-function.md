# What’s in the Gene function?

Gene function view presents protein information for all coding transcripts of the gene of interest. It is therefore only available for protein coding genes.
 
By default, the protein list is sorted by the amino acid length and specifies the protein name and the Ensembl protein stable ID with its corresponding transcript stable ID. Ensembl canonical flag is shown on the left if available. You can show/hide extra information by clicking on the protein of interest. The top line is expanded by default.
 
Expanded view displays a graphical representation of the focus protein (shown in blue) and position of its domains (dark grey boxes) relative to the longest translation (in light grey). You can find the protein domain source on the left and its description on the right.
 
External links to matching protein entries available for the expanded protein are listed below the diagram. Those include records from the EBI protein resources, such as InterPro, UniProt and PDBe-KB. PDBe-KB entry types and counts are illustrated by black icons.
 
You can also export the amino acid and coding sequence (CDS) for the expanded translation by ticking the relevant box(es) and clicking on the green Download button.
