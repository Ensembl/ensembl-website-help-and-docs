# What’s in the external references panel?
 
The external references panel lists links to related records in various external databases. Gene-related references are given first, followed by references for each transcript below. These include external protein records for protein coding genes and transcripts. Click on the Ensembl stable transcript ID to show/hide corresponding entries. References are grouped by source and collapsed by default – click on the downward arrow to expand them.
