# What is the Entity viewer?

Entity viewer reveals detailed information about an entity ie a gene, variant or location of interest and their related transcripts, proteins and functions.

The Entity viewer consists of a Navigation bar, the Main display, the Right-hand panel and an Action bar.

## Navigation bar

The Navigation bar summarises details of an entity such as a gene, variant or location. Eg A gene summary lists the gene symbol, Ensembl stable ID, biotype, strand and genomic coordinates. 

The information about an entity that can be seen in the Right-hand panel are also listed on the Navigation bar eg an overview and references are listed for a gene, this information can be seen by opening the Right-hand side panel.  

## Main display

The Main display presents detailed data relating to the entity ie a gene, variant or location of interest. 

Visual summary
A visual summary of the entity ie a gene is found at the top of the Main display. 

The visual summary for a gene shows a Ensembl gene stable ID, the genes length, strand and transcript count. Exon are represented with grey boxes and introns with grey lines.

Please note that the gene is always displayed in the 5’->3’ orientation, regardless of the strand. 

You can also go to the Genome browser from here to view your gene of interest plotted against the genome, by clicking the ‘View in Genome browser’ icon.

Detailed data tabs

Detailed data about an entity is found in the tabs below the visual summary, for genes the

Transcript tab shows all transcripts for the gene. 

Gene function tab present protein information for all coding transcripts for the gene of interest.  

An ‘active’ tab appears black.


## Right-hand panel
 
The Right-hand panel provides additional information about the entity of interest. For a gene this information is found in the Overview and External reference tabs.
 

## Action bar

The Action bar displays a variety of actions you can take. Each action is represented by a specific icon.

Select the right pointing arrow to open and close the Right-hand panel.

Select the magnifying glass icon to search for an entity eg a gene 

Previously viewed

Select the bookmark icon to see previously viewed entities ie genes, transcripts or variants.

Previously viewed is an auto-generated browsing history of up to 20 genes (or other entities) previously loaded within the Entity viewer application.
 
Download

Select the underlined down arrow icon to download sequence data.

Download enables export of the sequence data for an entity. If your entity is a gene you can download the genomic sequence and all of its transcripts and translations.

To download tick the box next to the sequence data you need then select the green Download button. Sequence data is exported in FASTA format.
